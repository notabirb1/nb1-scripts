# Setup
*Windows-Only*
1. Store these scripts in a location you will **not** move.  
2. Open shell:startup from the Run Menu (Win + R).  
3. Create shortcuts for both of these scripts in the startup folder.  
- **These scripts MUST be set to run via "pyw", otherwise you will see the console windows!**
