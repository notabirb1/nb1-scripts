# nb1-scripts
 A collection of scripts I have created, mainly for personal use.
## Current Scripts
## Aliases
### Open Directory (openDir)
- Allows the user to set shortcuts to folders.
- Supports parameters (eg. openDir Desktop)
### Return to Directory (returnDir)
- An extension of the "openDir" script that allows you to return to the previous directory.
### Java Version Switcher (java8.bat)
- Allows the user to run a java program with another installed version of java.
## Python
##### (Moved from notabirb1/pythonstuff)
### Bing Wallpaper Python
- A python-based alternative to the official Bing Wallpaper app from Microsoft.
- Created over privacy concerns, and for fun.
- Unlike the official app from Microsoft, this script only runs at startup, with the (small) caveat that you cannot see information about the Image of the Day.
### Emoticon Shortcuts
- A python script that allows the user to input emoticons (such as ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ) & specific unicode characters (⠀) via. keyboard shortcuts.
### Keyboard Shortcuts Python
- A python script that allows the user to set custom keybinds to open programs / run commands.
- This only exists because Windows doesn't have it, and I was too stubborn to use AutoHotkey.
